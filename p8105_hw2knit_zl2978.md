I will first load the library.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──

``` r
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1

I will first set the path to the data

``` r
path_to_data_TW = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Then I will read the data and clean the data

``` r
trashwheel_df = read_xlsx(
    path = path_to_data_TW,
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
mutate(
    sports_balls = round (sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer (sports_balls)
)
```

Then I will read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018

``` r
ppt_2017 = read_xlsx(
    path = path_to_data_TW,
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(month) %>% 
mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
relocate(year)

ppt_2018 = read_xlsx(
    path = path_to_data_TW,
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(month) %>% 
mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
relocate(year)
```

Next, I will combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a
character variable

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(month = 1:12,
           month_name = month.name)
precip_df = 
      bind_rows(ppt_2017, ppt_2018)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
select(-month)
```

This dataset reports data from the Mr. Trashwheel trash collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. The dataset contains information on year, month,
and trash collected, include some specific kinds of trash. For the data
of Trash Wheel, there are a total of 344 rows. The median number of
sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.Additional data sheets
include month precipitation data in year 2017 and year 2018. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and total precipitation in each
month. There are a total of 24 rows. The total precipitation in 2018 was
70.33 inches. The total precipitation in 2017 was 32.93 inches.

\#\#Problem 2 I will read and clean the data

``` r
NYC_Transit_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_data.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
mutate(entry = if_else(entry == "YES", T, F)) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information on line, station name, specific
location (longitude, latitude), route information, if there is an
entry,if there is a vending, the entrance type, and if there is an APA
compliance of each subway station in NYC. I have clean the names of this
dataset, drop several variabes that we are not interested in and mutate
the entry variable to a logical variable. There are a total of 1868 rows
and a total of 19 columns. I do not think the data is tidy enough. For
the route variables, I think we may combine them into a single variable.
For example, for the first row, the value of route could be
“RNNNNNNNNNN” where N stands for NA, and this will reduce 10 columns
for our final data frame. In addition, since we dropped the variable
“corner”, several rows appear to be totally same and the difference
between different rows which represent the same stations is relatively
meaningless.For example, the reader of this dataset will not understand
why row 4 and row 5 exist and the same time.

There are 465 distinct stations, and 84 stations are ADA compliant. The
proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance
is 0.3770492

Then I will reformat data so that route number and route name are
distinct variables.

``` r
NYC_reformat_transit = 
NYC_Transit_data %>% 
mutate(
  route8 = as.character(route8),
  route9 = as.character(route9),
  route10 = as.character(route10),
  route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% 
pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    values_to = "route_name" 
) %>% 
mutate(route_number = substr(route_number,6,8))
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train, and 17 are ADA
compliant.
