I will first load the library.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──

``` r
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1

I will first set the path to the data

``` r
path_to_data_TW = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Then I will read the data and clean the data

``` r
trashwheel_df = read_xlsx(
    path = path_to_data_TW,
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
mutate(
    sports_balls = round (sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer (sports_balls)
)
```

Then I will read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018

``` r
ppt_2017 = read_xlsx(
    path = path_to_data_TW,
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(month) %>% 
mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
relocate(year)

ppt_2018 = read_xlsx(
    path = path_to_data_TW,
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1) %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(month) %>% 
mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
relocate(year)
```

Next, I will combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a
character variable

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(month = 1:12,
           month_name = month.name)
precip_df = 
      bind_rows(ppt_2017, ppt_2018)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
select(-month)
```

This dataset reports data from the Mr. Trashwheel trash collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. The dataset contains information on year, month,
and trash collected, include some specific kinds of trash. For the data
of Trash Wheel, there are a total of 344 rows. The median number of
sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.Additional data sheets
include month precipitation data in year 2017 and year 2018. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and total precipitation in each
month. There are a total of 24 rows. The total precipitation in 2018 was
70.33 inches. The total precipitation in 2017 was 32.93 inches.

\#\#Problem 2 I will read and clean the data

``` r
NYC_Transit_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_data.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
mutate(entry = if_else(entry == "YES", T, F)) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains information on line, station name, specific
location (longitude, latitude), route information, if there is an
entry,if there is a vending, the entrance type, and if there is an APA
compliance of each subway station in NYC. I have clean the names of this
dataset, drop several variabes that we are not interested in and mutate
the entry variable to a logical variable. There are a total of 1868 rows
and a total of 19 columns. I do not think the data is tidy enough. For
the route variables, I think we may combine them into a single variable.
For example, for the first row, the value of route could be
“RNNNNNNNNNN” where N stands for NA, and this will reduce 10 columns
for our final data frame. In addition, since we dropped the variable
“corner”, several rows appear to be totally same and the difference
between different rows which represent the same stations is relatively
meaningless.For example, the reader of this dataset will not understand
why row 4 and row 5 exist and the same time.

There are 465 distinct stations, and 84 stations are ADA compliant. The
proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance
is 0.3770492

Then I will reformat data so that route number and route name are
distinct variables.

``` r
NYC_reformat_transit = 
NYC_Transit_data %>% 
mutate(
  route8 = as.character(route8),
  route9 = as.character(route9),
  route10 = as.character(route10),
  route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% 
pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    values_to = "route_number" 
) %>% 
mutate(route_name = substr(route_name,6,8)) 
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train, and 17 are ADA
compliant.

\#\#Problem 3 I will first read and tidy the data.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
separate(mon, into = c("year","month","day"), sep = "-") %>%
mutate(month = as.integer(month)) %>% 
left_join(month_df, by = "month") %>% 
mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
select(-month_name) %>% 
mutate(president = recode(prez_gop, "1" = "gop", "0" = "dem")) %>% 
select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day) %>% 
relocate(year,month,president) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

    ## Warning: Problem with `mutate()` input `president`.
    ## ℹ Unreplaced values treated as NA as .x is not compatible. Please specify replacements exhaustively or supply .default
    ## ℹ Input `president` is `recode(prez_gop, `1` = "gop", `0` = "dem")`.

    ## Warning: Unreplaced values treated as NA as .x is not compatible. Please specify
    ## replacements exhaustively or supply .default

I did not recode the prez\_gop = 2 and it changes to NA automatically.

Then I will clean the data in snp.csv.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
separate(date, into = c("month","day","year"), sep = "/") %>%
mutate(month = as.integer(month)) %>% 
left_join(month_df, by = "month") %>% 
mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
select(-month_name,-day) %>% 
relocate(year,month) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

I drop the day variable so that it can be merged with the other two data
and easier to understand.

Then I will tidy the unemployment data.

``` r
monthabb_df = 
    tibble(month = tolower(month.abb),
           month_name = month.name)
unemp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
pivot_longer(
  jan:dec,
  names_to = "month",
  values_to = "unemployment_rate"
) %>% 
left_join(monthabb_df, by = "month") %>% 
mutate(month = month_name) %>% 
select(-month_name)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Then I will join the datasets.

``` r
merge_df =
  merge(pols_df,snp_df) %>% 
merge(unemp_df)
```

Until now, I have 4 datasets in total. The first one is pols\_df which
contains the information about the year, month, president type, the
number of republican and democratic governors, the number of republican
and democratic senators and the number of republican and democratic
representatives on a given date. There are 822 rows and 9 columns. The
range of the year is from 1947 to 2015, one important variable in this
data frame is the president which represents if the president is
democratic or republican.

The second one is snp.csv which contains the information about the year,
month and the closing values of the S\&P stock index on the associated
date. The variable close represents the closing values of the stock
index. There are 787 rows and 3 columns. The range of the year is from
1950 to 2015. Besides, I drop the day variable for better merging with
the other two data frame.

The third one is unemp\_df which contains the information about the
year, month and the unemployment rate at that time. The variable
unemployment\_rate represents the unemployment rate. There are 816 rows
and 3 columns. The range of the year is from 1948 to 2015.

The last one is the dataset that merge all three datasets and
information together. I have clean the names of all these three
datasets. I have convert all the data variable in these three dataset to
a same format which are year and month, and the month value are
expressed as words. Besides, I have relocate the year and month as the
first two columns.

The last dataset contains the information about the year, month,
president type, the number of republican and democratic governors, the
number of republican and democratic senators and the number of
republican and democratic representatives on a given date, closing
values of the stock index, and the unemployment rate. Key variables are
president, unempolyment\_rate and close. There are 786 rows and 11
columns. The range of the year is from 1950 to 2015.
